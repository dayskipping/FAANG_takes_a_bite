# FAANG takes a bite out of the S&P
## Survey of mega cap tech stocks and their share of S&amp;P market cap

  As we advance into the future, the growth and dominance of mega-cap technology stocks has emerged as an undeniable trend. With this growth,  these companies have taken an ever increasing share of the overall market capitalization of the US equity market. Over the past few years a popular acronym for these key players has emerged, 'FANG', with its constituents being Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. I have included Apple in this group as well since it is the currently the largest technology stock by market cap. I have chosen the S&P 500 as a proxy measure of the US equity market since it is one of the most highly pegged measurements of US equities. This project aims to survey the market cap of these names against the total market cap of the S&P 500 index in order to quantify their current dominance and forecast their potential future share of the total S&P market cap.

## Exploring the data

  My first goal was to understand how correlated these stocks are with each other and the S&P. As displayed below, we can clearly see that the entire group is highly correlated with each other the lowest correlation being **.80**
